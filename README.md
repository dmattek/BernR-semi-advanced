This tutorial accompanies the [BernR MeetUp: Semi-advanced R programming tricks](https://www.meetup.com/Bern-R/events/xbnxlqyzgblb/).

The tutorial uses following packages:

  - `pacman` for package loading, see [here](https://github.com/trinker/pacman),
  - `data.table` for data wrangling,
  - `ggplot2` for plotting,
  - `plotly` for interactive plotting.

The tutorial in `script01.Rmd` notebook covers following topics:

  - Working with RStudio projects, code formatting, syntax conventions.
  - Converting between long and wide data formats.
  - Plotting with `ggplot2`, including interactive plotting with `plotly`.
  - Wrapping code into functions, and documenting them with `Roxygen`.
